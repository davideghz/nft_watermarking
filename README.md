# NFT-Watermarking
## Project description
The NFT-Watermarking app is a web application created for the creation of NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, with a strong commitment to privacy enhancements. This platform incorporates AI-robust watermarks and content reduction to ensure exclusive access to the comprehensive content of each NFT for its designated owner. The project strategically employs ICPâ€™s canisters for secure data storage, NFT protection, ownership verification, seamless content delivery, and efficient front-end hosting.

## Features overview
- *IDEA*: Watermarking Service to ensure image privacy with watermarked NFT images.
- *Wallet Connect*: Exclusively view watermark-free images if the user is connected with Wallet Connect and the user is the owner of the NFT
- *ICP Storage*: Securely store static files and metadata on ICP, while preserving the NFT's core on its original blockchain, since the image link is available like a link on IPFS
- *User Authentication*: Log in with Internet Identity, enabling authenticated access to private NFT content to mint NFT. Each user initiates an authenticated call to the ICP canister, facilitating a secure match for accessing their private NFT content.
